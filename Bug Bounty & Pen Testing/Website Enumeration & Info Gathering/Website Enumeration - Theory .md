# Notes

We want to learn as much as possible about our target before we start attacking

any info about the website can be useful

we must open up the website and explore

- usually the first thing we want to do is get IP address of website or domain
- then we should look at website structure (does it have js, third party apps, etc)
- look at login pages / user input fields and see if you can access it and interact with
- figure where the website is hosted, what type of server, etc
- see if you can interact with the database
- see if the website has encryption

tools we will use:
- nmap
- nikto
- dirb
- google
